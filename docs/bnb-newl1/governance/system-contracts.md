# System Contracts

BNB NewL1 predeploys a set of system contracts at genesis, at fixed addresses, covering staking, governance, and the chain's own novel features (Multi-Lane, the shielded pool, and account abstraction). Most of the staking/governance contracts reuse BNB Smart Chain's audited bytecode directly; the rest are new to BNB NewL1.

| Contract | Address | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ValidatorSet` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000` | The active validator roster that consensus reads each epoch. |
| `SlashIndicator` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001` | Records downtime/missed-block behavior and drives slashing. |
| `SystemReward` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001002` | Holds and distributes block rewards. |
| `GovHub` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001007` | The single entry point governed contracts accept parameter changes from. |
| `CrossChain` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002000` | Placeholder occupying BSC's cross-chain address. No bridge traffic and no governance messages today — see the note below. |
| `StakeHub` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002002` | Core staking hub: validator registration, delegation, and election bookkeeping. |
| `StakeCredit` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002003` | Per-validator share-pool implementation (one proxy deployed per validator). |
| `Governor` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002004` | Governance proposal lifecycle: propose, vote, determine success. |
| `GovToken` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002005` | govBNB — the non-transferable voting-power token, minted 1:1 by `StakeHub`. |
| `Timelock` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000002006` | Enforces the mandatory delay between a passed vote and execution. |
| `LaneRegistry` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000003000` | [Multi-Lane](../core-concepts/multi-lane.md) quotas and address routing. |
| `AccountKeychain` (precompile) | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000004000` | [Account abstraction](../core-concepts/account-abstraction.md) key registry — authorize/revoke/read delegated keys. |
| `SignatureVerifier` (precompile) | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000004001` | Verifies AA signatures (secp256k1 / P256 / WebAuthn) on behalf of the AA pipeline. |
| `ShieldedPool` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005000` | [Privacy](../core-concepts/privacy.md) system contract — deposit / withdraw / transfer / atomic-call, with an embedded zk-proof verifier. |
| `ShieldedAuthVerifier` | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000005003` | Auth-proof verifier used by the shielded pool. |

## Notes

- `ValidatorSet`, `SlashIndicator`, `SystemReward`, `StakeHub`, `StakeCredit`, `GovToken`, `Governor`, and `Timelock` are the staking/governance stack carried over from BNB Smart Chain, kept at the same addresses so their embedded bytecode's internal cross-references remain valid. `Governor`/`Timelock` are recompiled with BNB NewL1's own governance-timing constants (voting period, proposal threshold, timelock delay), which are still devnet-only values and not finalized for a public network.
- `CrossChain` exists purely so `ValidatorSet`'s epoch-update logic finds a non-empty contract at that address, mirroring a BSC internal check — it does not carry governance traffic on BNB NewL1.
- `LaneRegistry`, `AccountKeychain`/`SignatureVerifier`, and `ShieldedPool`/`ShieldedAuthVerifier` are BNB NewL1–original — they have no BNB Smart Chain equivalent.
- `AccountKeychain` and `SignatureVerifier` are **enshrined precompiles** (Rust logic compiled directly into the EVM's precompile map), not deployed bytecode, which is why they sit in their own reserved address band separate from the deployed system contracts above.
